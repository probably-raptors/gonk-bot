It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground!
It ought to be here...but it isn't...
I don't like sand.

I don't care _what_ universe you're from, that's got to hurt!
_So_ uncivilized.

_Your_ new empire!?
If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.
_Noooooooooooooooooo!
Oh no, I'm not brave enough for politics.
Master! Destroyers!
